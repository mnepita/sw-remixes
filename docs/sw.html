      <h2>ONE OF THE MOST ECLECTIC AND PROLIFIC ARTISTS IN ROCK MUSIC</h2>
      <p>Steven Wilson has been writing, recording, and producing music continuously since the age of 10. A native of Hemel
      Hempstead in England, Steven was first exposed to music at the age of eight, when he started hearing his father
      listening to Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon,” and his mother to Donna Summer’s “Love to Love You Baby,” two albums
      that were pivotal in the development of his musical direction. His father, an electrical engineer, built him a
      multi-track tape machine, and he began to experiment with overdubbing and developing a repertoire of production
      techniques.</p>

      <p>Early demo tapes started to emerge in the mid 80’s while Steven was still at school, and at the end of the
      decade he created the two projects which gained him entry to the professional music world: Porcupine Tree and No Man.
      Porcupine Tree, which explored psychedelia, progressive music, and his love of ambitious seventies music, was initially
      an imaginary “band” which, in reality, Steven overdubbed all the instruments himself. This even extended to early demo
      tapes coming with a fictional written history of the band, and biographical info about the fictitious performers.</p>

      <p>Around the same time, Steven formed No-Man, his long-term collaboration with singer Tim Bowness. Influenced by everything from
      ambient music to hip-hop, their early singles and albums were a mixture of dance beats and lush orchestrations. Signing
      to One Little Indian in the UK, and Epic in the US in 1990, they received tremendous accolades from the music press,
      with Singles Of The Week in Melody Maker, Sounds and Hot Press.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, things progressed with Porcupine Tree, whose increasing popularity was fast outpacing the imaginary pretext
      of an actual group. The second full-length album, Up the Downstair was released in 1993 and was praised by Melody Maker
      as “a psychedelic masterpiece… one of the albums of the year.” This was the first album to include keyboardist Richard
      Barbieri and bassist Colin Edwin, albeit only as guests at this point, the album was still effectively a solo
      project.The next album The Sky Moves Sideways was a transitional album featuring both solo SW and band pieces, but from
      then on it became a full band with the addition of Chris Maitland on drums. Further albums throughout the late nineties,
      and extensive touring resulted in a string of indie chart placings and critical acclaim, many fans hailing them as the
      Pink Floyd of the nineties.</p>

      <p>
        In 2001 Porcupine Tree was signed to US label Lava Records, under the auspices of Atlantic Records. Now with the support
        of a major label, and featuring new drummer Gavin Harrison, In Absentia saw the light of day in 2002, featuring a
        heavier sound than all the group’s previous works. It charted in many European countries and remains one of the
        top-selling Porcupine Tree albums. It was also their first album to be released in 5.1 Surround Sound,, and won the
        “Best Made-For-Surround Title” award for the Surround Music Awards 2004. Its 2005 follow-up, Deadwing was inspired by a
        film script written by Steven and film-maker Mike Bennion, and became the first Porcupine Tree album to chart around the
        world. The album won “Album of the Year” at the Classic Rock magazine awards, and its surround version received the
        “Best Made-For-Surround Title” once again.
